Code 2 is a continuation of the principles and techniques taught in Code 1. Students will expand their conceptual and technical skills in the pursuit of mastering code and computational thinking as a tool for creative, critical, and aesthetic exploration and expression. The class content will focus on building more complex systems and exploring specific creative applications of code. Topics will include data, 3d, advanced object-oriented programming, and the historical and cultural context of software in art and design. Students will use Processing to produce interactive and experiential work, culminating in a creative final project.
