// take your class from sketch_10 and create an ArrayList of them.
// clicking the mouse on the screen should create a new instance of the object at that position.
// loop through the arraylist in the draw loop and draw all of them.
// finally, add some new behavior to the class.
// for example, a particle 'lifetime' effect that makes them disappear after some time.
